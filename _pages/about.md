Hi, I'm Dan! Welcome to my website! Here is some brief information about me:
- I am a Dual Degree PhD Student at [Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) and at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico's Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://dei.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Professors [Maarten Sap](https://maartensap.com/) and [Chrysoula Zerva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S5NGkFsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

# Interests

I am broadly interested in natural language processing, human computer interaction, and computational social justice. I am especially interested in how large language models and recommender systems perpetuate linguistic and sociological biases.

# Highlights

- I began my PhD at CMU LTI (Aug. 2024)!

# Brief Biography

I was recently a research assistant for [Nikola Banovic](https://www.nikolabanovic.net/) and [Nel Escher](https://kescher.github.io/cool-zone/) in the [Computational HCI Lab](https://x.com/i/flow/login?redirect_after_login=%2FCompHCILab) at the University of Michigan. I was also formerly a [SULI Intern](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli) at Argonne National Laboratory, and a [DSI Summer Lab RA](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/) at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute.

When not working, I enjoy playing piano, crocheting amigurumi stuffies, and expanding my knowledge of the fictional world
