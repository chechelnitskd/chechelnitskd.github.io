Hi, I'm Dan! Here is some information about me:
- I am a second-year Ph.D. Student at [Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), supported by a [CMU Portugal Program](https://cmuportugal.org/) Scholarship.
- I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Maarten Sap](https://maartensap.com/) and [Chrysoula Zerva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S5NGkFsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
- I speak English and Russian fluently. I am also conversational in Belarusian, Mandarin Chinese, and Portuguese.
- Here is a link to my [curriculum vitae](https://chechelnitskd.github.io/Chechelnitsky_CV_2025.pdf).

# Interests
- I am broadly interested in **multilingual NLP**, human-computer interaction, computational social science, and linguistics.
- I am specifically interested in observing and incorporating **user perspectives** of language technologies into building more **speaker-centered** translation and multilingual systems, with specific emphasis on **minoritized dialects and low resource languages**.

# Highlights
- (Jun. 2025) I presented a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05660) [Jeffrey Basoah](https://jeffreybasoah.github.io/) and I wrote about LLMs' usage of sociolects at FAccT in Athens 🇬🇷!
- (Aug. 2024) I moved to Pittsburgh to begin my PhD!

# Prior Experience
- I was previously a research assistant for [Nikola Banovic](https://www.nikolabanovic.net/) and [Nel Escher](https://kescher.github.io/cool-zone/) in the [Computational HCI Lab](https://x.com/comphcilab) at the University of Michigan. I was also formerly a [SULI Intern](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli) at Argonne National Laboratory and a [DSI Summer Lab RA](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/) at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute.
- Before that, I spent four impactful years at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) in St. Paul, Minnesota. Alongside my coursework, I also completed an [honors project](https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/mathcs_honors/69/) where I prototyped a Google Maps extension designed to reduce driving anxiety. I am still a very active part of the alumni community at [yMac](https://www.facebook.com/groups/yMac1/), so if you are a current Macalester student or a recent grad please don't hesitate to reach out! Go Scots!
