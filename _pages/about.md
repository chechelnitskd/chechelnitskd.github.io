Hi, I'm Dan! Here is some information about me:
- I am a first-year Dual Degree PhD Student at [Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) and at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico's Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://dei.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/).
- I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Professors [Maarten Sap](https://maartensap.com/) and [Chrysoula Zerva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S5NGkFsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
- I speak English and Russian fluently. I am also conversational in Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, and Turkish.
- Here is a link to my [curriculum vitae](https://chechelnitskd.github.io/Chechelnitsky_CV_2024.pdf).

# Interests

I am broadly interested in natural language processing, human-computer interaction, and **computational social justice**. 

I am especially interested in how we can use **decolonial computing** techniques as part of algorithmic audits and qualitative analyses of language models to expose and combat the **systematic social and cultural biases** these systems contain.

# Highlights

- (Aug. 2024) I moved to Pittsburgh to begin my PhD at CMU LTI!

# Prior Experience

I was recently a research assistant for [Nikola Banovic](https://www.nikolabanovic.net/) and [Nel Escher](https://kescher.github.io/cool-zone/) in the [Computational HCI Lab](https://x.com/i/flow/login?redirect_after_login=%2FCompHCILab) at the University of Michigan. I was also formerly a [SULI Intern](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli) at Argonne National Laboratory, and a [DSI Summer Lab RA](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/) at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute.
