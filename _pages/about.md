Hi, I'm Dan! Here is some information about me:
- I am a first-year Dual Degree Ph.D. Student at [Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) and at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico's Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://dei.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/).
- I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Professors [Maarten Sap](https://maartensap.com/) and [Chrysoula Zerva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S5NGkFsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
- I speak English and Russian fluently. I am also conversational in Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, and Turkish.
- Here is a link to my [curriculum vitae](https://chechelnitskd.github.io/Chechelnitsky_CV_2024.pdf).

# Interests
- I am broadly interested in **computational social science**, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. 
- I am especially interested in how we can use **decolonial computing** methods such an ethnographically informed algorithmic auditing and community-centered design to expose and combat the **systematic and systemic social biases** prevalent in language models.
- As an aspiring researcher, I am constantly looking to expand my knowledge and learn more about recent developments in the fields of computer science and linguistics. Currently as part of my Ph.D. coursework, I am developing practical skills in **multimodal machine learning** and **information retrieval** techniques.

# Highlights
- (Oct. 2024) Celebrated my 25th birthday ðŸ¥³!
- (Aug. 2024) I moved to Pittsburgh to begin my PhD!

# Prior Experience
- I was recently a research assistant for [Nikola Banovic](https://www.nikolabanovic.net/) and [Nel Escher](https://kescher.github.io/cool-zone/) in the [Computational HCI Lab](https://x.com/comphcilab) at the University of Michigan. I was also formerly a [SULI Intern](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli) at Argonne National Laboratory and a [DSI Summer Lab RA](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/) at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute.
- Before that, I was a Linguistics major at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) in St. Paul, Minnesota (Go Scots!). Alongside my coursework, I completed an [Honor's Project](https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/mathcs_honors/69/) that prototyped a Google Maps extension designed to reduce driving anxiety.
